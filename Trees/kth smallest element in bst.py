# 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST

# Hint
# Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
# Output: 1
# Example 2:


# Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
# Output: 3
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the tree is n.
# 1 <= k <= n <= 104
# 0 <= Node.val <= 104
 

# Follow up: If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?
